Technologies Used: Azure: {Keyvaults, App Services, Front Door, WAF} PHP, HTML, Docker, OpenSSL

In this project, I acquired valuable knowledge and skills in developing and designing a cyber blog web application. Leveraging the power of Azure's Cloud services and Docker, I successfully created a robust and scalable web application infrastructure.

To ensure the security and integrity of the web application, I implemented a comprehensive SSL certificate management system using Azure's Key Vault. This allowed me to securely store and retrieve SSL certificates and bind them to the web application, providing a secure browsing experience for users.

In addition to SSL certificate management, I implemented various Azure security features to protect the web application from potential threats. Azure's Front Door service played a crucial role in load balancing traffic and providing an additional layer of security, while Azure's Web Application Firewall enhanced the application's security by filtering and blocking malicious requests.

To ensure ongoing security, I integrated Azure Security Center, which provided valuable insights and recommendations to proactively monitor and protect the web application. This helped me stay informed about potential security vulnerabilities and take necessary measures to mitigate risks.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in developing and securing web applications using Azure's Cloud services and security features. By utilizing technologies like Docker, SSL certificates from Azure Key Vault, and implementing Azure's security services, I successfully designed a robust and secure cyber blog web application.
