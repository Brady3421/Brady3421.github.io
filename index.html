                <h3>The Silent Threat Lurking at ATMs and Gas Stations</h3>
                <h4>Hacking, Threats</h4>
                <p>
                    In our increasingly digital world, cashless transactions have become the norm. However, there is still a need for physical currency, and many of us rely on ATMs and gas station pumps to access cash or make payments. Unfortunately, these convenient machines have become targets for a stealthy menace known as skimmers. Skimmers are sophisticated devices that criminals use to steal your card information and wreak havoc on your financial life.
